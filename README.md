# NServiceBus.Metrics

NServiceBus.Metrics provides a convenient way to collect metric data about the performance of running endpoints, like Processing Time or Critical Time. These metrics are then periodically sent to the Metrics Processing Component via a configured NServiceBus transport.

It is part of the [Particular Service Platform](https://particular.net/service-platform), which includes [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus) and tools to build, monitor, and debug distributed systems.

See the [Metrics documentation](https://docs.particular.net/monitoring/metrics/) for more details on how to use it.
