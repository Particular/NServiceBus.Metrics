# NServiceBus.Metrics

NServiceBus.Metrics provides a convenient way of gathering metrics like processing time or critical time. It hooks into the NServiceBus pipeline and calculates Processing Time. These metrics are then periodically sent to the Metrics Processing Component via a configured NServiceBus transport.

It is part of the [Particular Service Platform](https://particular.net/service-platform), which includes [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus) and tools to build, monitor, and debug distributed systems.

See the [Metrics documentation](https://docs.particular.net/monitoring/metrics/) for more details on how to use it.
